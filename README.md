# coding-events-1
This app allows the user to create a list of categories of events, and create events with a name, description, contact email, category and an automatic generated ID. 

App is fully operational, including creating, listing, and deleting, categories and events with additional features on the way.

Future improvement will be adding a login page for individual users.
Include a seperate page for adding a new user from the main login page.
Notes on adding Person class:
Person class fields: username, password, emailAddress, PK ID
Person has one-to-one relationship with the Event Class
Also needs a PersonRepository and a login page controller.
